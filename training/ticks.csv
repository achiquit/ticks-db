Crossed paths with two women rapping down as I was finishing up P1. Rigged P3 to rap after leading it so I didn&#39;t have to reclimb. Beautiful views of the city the whole way up!",,

Such an incredible climb, absolute classic!! Followed the A0 pitch, but got it clean. Would love to come back and lead odds to lead the 5.10 pitch too. 6 hours base to summit ",,8
