1,"SRMG",50,"Climbed Neck Press, Triple S, and Marshall’s. No tip even though it was a good time out on the rock. Not sure how much experience she has actually catching falls since she always hires guides. Later note: She ended up tipping 50 a month and a half later after Tom scolded her"
2,"SRMG",200,"Climbed Candy Corner to Bee Sting then Thais."
3,"SRMG",125,"Climbed Thais Escape then top roped Cast of Thousands"
4,"SRMG",150,"Climbed Conn’s West, rapped PO, then top roped P1 of Prune. Tim struggled a bit on Conn’s and on the rappel, but enjoyed himself. Kathy killed it all day, she could climb harder for sure."
5,"SRMG",40,"Climbed Old Mans with Paige, John (Johnathan), and Paige’s  boyfriend who I can’t remember the name of right now"
6,"GENERIC",0,"Generic clients"
7,"SRMG",150,"Day 1: Did mock leads all day, got spooked off Totem half way up by rock fall, most likely from highliners. Did Ecstasy Toe in two pitches, then Gert’s Grungy Gully in 2 pitches. Day 2: Showed him how to rig the spike for TR, then he led Totem and the first two pitches of Skyline. Talked about both BLMs and cop stuff"
8,"SRMG",100,"Climbed Old Ladies since they’d already climbed Old Man’s. We rapped PO and got caught in a bad thunderstorm right at the end and sheltered under my tarp right at the base."
9,"SRMG",40,"TR day. Did Humphrey’s Head, then tagged with another party to get a rope on Triple S. Almost did Seneca Daze and Cast of Thousands, but got chased down by the rain so we went to SOPO and did Block Party and Ambush"
10,"SRMG",0,"SRMG kids camp. Climbed with Asher and two others whose names are slipping me at the moment, but they were all really good friends. Did first two pitches of Neckpress, then the last pitch of Old Mans to get to the summit. Ran into Douglas and Ed again on the rappel.  "
11,"SRMG",30,"Climbed Totem, Candy Corner, and Ye Gods. Turns out they had already done Totem AND Candy Corner in 2019, but were perfectly pleased with doing them again. Next time it would be better to go up to Humphrey’s Head for sure, then on to something like Prune and Seneca Daze."
12,"SRMG",70.9,"TR day. Did Roy Gap Chimney, Block Party, Ambush, and Fear of Flying. Sick day out, everyone climbs on sport so they all knew what was going on and could easily TR belay well. Really relaxed, fun day out :)"
13,"SRMG",20,"TR day at the south end. Did everything on the spike, then ecstasy toe, then tried to do Totem but got rained out and taught the parents how to clean sport anchors instead."
14,"SRMG",250,"Bitaemo / PLAST Ukrainian camp 2025. My group was Lev, Kalyna, and Augusten"
15,"SRMG",150,"2 day course on trad fundamentals. Day 1 was cut short halfway through so we could respond to an accident on Banana, but we got some ground school on in the morning. Day 2 we did some mock leads and anchor building on Ecstasy Toe, then mock leads on Totem. Stayed out super late Day 2, until about 7:30 or so."
16,"SRMG",50,"Father daughter pair, daughter was around 13. Super chatty and really nice. Old Man’s was a great challenge level for them this time. Both of their first rappels, did a tandem rappel with Faith"
17,"SRMG",40,"Family of four, mom runs a non profit climbing gym and climbed a lot in her younger days. Ethan, dad is not much of a climber, the kids are good"

19,"SRMG",100,"Climbed Old Man’s to the summit, Conn’s West rap, then top roped Seneca Daze and P1 of Prune. He crushed it! He could definitely upgrade to something a lil’ harder next time"
20,"SRMG",300,"Three day learn to bigwall course. These three guys are also homies with the folks from 15! This crew is always a good time."
21,"SRMG",100,"Did a skyline traverse basically. LSD to Skyline, Up and Coming, Old Ladies, Windy Corner, rapped Orangeaid, then climbed into the notch and hit the north peak. Ran a 70m leading from the middle and mostly belayed with a gi-gi. Get a bi-pattern rope for doing that next time!"
22,"SRMG",40,"Old man’s to the summit, PO rappel, then TR Seneca Daze. Super busy on the rock but we got it all done!"
